    /// is to delete all instances of `Feature` in order to have a clean start.
    /// This isn't a problem because the client creates its own default instance
    /// and quickly fetches updates from the backend.

    /// On-premise backends that don't support the conference calling config endpoint
    /// will never be able to deliver a config to the client. The client however, will
    /// then use the default config, which effectively disables conference calling.
    /// Thus, on-prem customers erroneously lose conference calling.
    ///
    /// The fix:
    ///
    /// 1. Delete the local conference calling config from the database (via this patch).
    /// 2. Change the default value to enable conference calling.
    /// 3. Reinsert the config with the new default value.
    /// 4. When the user is started, it will fetch the remote config value and update the local value.
    ///
    /// This means that for on-prem backends that don't support the conference calling feature
    /// config endpoint, we will use the new 'enabled' default. For all backends that do support
    /// the endpoint, their clients will just refetch the remote value.
