# Federation

## Overview

Businesses that use Wire in their organization have 2 choices, either deploy their teams in the Wire cloud or install an on-prem backend.

On-prem backends are isolated islands that before could not communicate with users from other on-prem islands or Wire cloud users.

Federation allows islands to be connected. Communication can be established between users from different backends the same way as on a single backend.
