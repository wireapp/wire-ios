     * When a new view controller is **pushed** or the stack is set, the state has already been updated, and the `currentViewController`
     * is equal to the view controller being pushed. We don't need to change the state.
     *
     * When the current view controller is **popped**, the state hasn't been updated (because it comes from user interaction),
     * so we need to unwind the state and update the current view controller to the one that is currently visible. In this case,
     * the view controller passed by the navigation controller is not equal to the `currentViewController`.
