/// Naming convention:
///
/// The names of all relationship protocols follow the format:
///
///  <module name><implementer><caller>Interface
///
/// For example, the name FooInteractorPresenterInterface is the relationship
/// implemented by the interactor, called by the presenter, and located in the
/// "Foo" module.
///
/// This format is designed to make it easy to search for a particular relationship protocol.
/// If you are searching for a particular protocol, type first the module name, then the
/// component that implements the methods, then the component that calls the methods.

/// Interface of the interactor from the perspective of the presenter.
///
/// Typically contains methods fetch data and perform business logic.
