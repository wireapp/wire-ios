# wire-ios-cryptobox

This framework is part of Wire iOS. Additional documentation is available in the [Wire iOS wiki](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/wiki).

This project provides for cross-compilation of [cryptobox](https://github.com/wireapp/cryptobox) for iOS, currently only in the form of static libraries.

## Integrating Objective-C Wrapper
You can integrate Objective-C Wrapper (Cryptobox.framework) using Carthage.
When Carthage will build it first time it will also build `libcryptobox.a` and `libsodium.a` in `Carthage/Checkouts/cryptobox-ios/build` with `libs` and `include` subfolders. So you can just add these paths to Libraries Search Paths and Headers Search Paths of your project.
