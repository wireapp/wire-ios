/**
 A cryptobox context that manages access to sessions, allowing the
 same sessions to be accessed by multuple processes in a safe way.
 Inside a process, only a single session context should be used.
 
 - note:
 In order to be used by multiple processes (see iOS extensions), cryptobox needs to lock the 
 directory with the key material as it works on it, so that no other process will touch it.
 
 This class introduces the concept of *encryption context*, similar to the concept of context in Core Data.
 A context must be used only from a single thread. Multiple contexts can refer to the same 
 directory on disk, locking the directory when needed so that they don't interfere with 
 each other.
 
 Conflicts and race conditions are avoided by loading from disk and saving to disk 
 every time a context it used, and locking around these operations. 
 This is slow, but extensions are not supposed to need to access 
 cryptobox very frequently.
 
 The intended use of this class is:
 
 1. Create context once, reuse the same context to avoid having to create/load identity 
    (which never changes once created, so no race condition other than during creation)
 2. use `perform:` with a block to create sessions, prekeys, encrypt and decrypt. 
    During the execution of the block, the directory is locked. 
    When decrypting, the decrypted data should be saved synchronously inside this block
    (e.g. in case of Core Data, should be inserted and immediately saved) to enforce it
    being saved before the session state is persisted later.
    If the decrypted data is not persisted, and there is a crash before the data is
    persisted, the data is lost forever as it can not be decrypted again once the session 
    is saved.
 3. When the block passed to `perform:` is completed, the sessions are persisted to disk.
    The lock is relased.
