# Technical Details
# 
# The tool `LicensePlist` has two modes that differ in essence:
# 
# 1. No Sandbox Mode / Online
# This mode requests all Swift Packages from the remote URLs, which seems convenient at first.
# However, it quickly reaches the GitHub API limit and suggests providing a GitHub token.
# Nevertheless, during development, I ran into API limits again because the project fetches 25+ licenses in parallel.
#
# 2. Sandbox Mode / Offline
# This mode allows you to work offline by providing a source path.
# Unfortunately, it seems to look only for Swift Packages and can no longer find the Carthage licenses.
# Therefore, the implemented workaround is to merge the SPM and Carthage folders into one temporary folder and generate licenses from it.
# Additionally, SPM binaries are not supported, so you need to download the LICENSE file manually and add it to the configuration.
