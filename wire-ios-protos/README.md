# wire-ios-protos

This framework is part of Wire iOS SyncEngine. Additional documentation is available in the [Wire iOS wiki](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/wiki).

The wire-ios-protos framework contains precompiled protocol buffer definitions for Swift.

## How to build

This framework is using Carthage to manage its dependencies. To pull the dependencies binaries, run `carthage bootstrap --platform ios --use-xcframeworks --no-use-binaries`.

You need the Swift Protocol Buffer compiler to build the protobuf Swift files. Run `brew install swift-protobuf` to install it.

From the `wire-ios-protos` directory, run `bash Scripts/compile-protos.sh` to generate the files from the protobuf definitions imported from Carthage.

You can now open the Xcode project and build.

## Troubleshooting

```
> bash Scripts/compile-swift-protos.sh 
  File "Scripts/find-carthage.py", line 30
    print("No Carthage folder found", file=sys.stderr)
                                          ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

If you encounter this error, you may need to update python to version 3
