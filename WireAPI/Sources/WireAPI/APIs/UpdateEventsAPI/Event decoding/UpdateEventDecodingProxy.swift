/// A wrapper that provides custom decoding of update events from
/// JSON payloads received from the backend.
///
/// The need for this wrapper arises from another need to persist
/// update events in a database: to persist an update event we
/// persist its encoded data, from which we need to decode it after
/// fetching it from the database. This coding and decoding needs
/// to be symmetric and for this we rely on the automatic conformance
/// of `UpdateEvent`.
///
/// However, we still need to decode the update events from the JSON
/// payloads we receive from the backend. This additional and manual
/// decoding is provided by `UpdateEventDecodingProxy`.
